The cake test creates a dessert object named cake and gives it a name of cake and a calorie value of 400.
It verifies that it can access these values and that they are what they are supposed to be. It also makes 
sure the deliciouse and healthy methods work by checking if they return the correct values, not healthy
and deliciouse

The second ceates an dessert object named apple with 75 calories. It then verifies it recieves the correct 
values from the two methods

the can set test verifies that it can write to the dessert object xxx after it has been created. it changes 
its name to icecream and itc calories to 80

the jellybean test two tests. it first creates a jellybean object named valilla. it verifies that it has 5 
calories and that its flavor gets attributed to its name correctly. It also verifies that it recieves a 
true value for the deliciouse method. The second test verifies that it recieves a false frome the deliciouse
test when the flavor is licorice

my test verifies that my class raises an argument error if someone tries to create a dessert object with a 
calorie value less than 0, as there are no foods, especially desserts that have negative calories. My other
test tests and makes sure a string or non-numeric value is attempted to be set for calories.
