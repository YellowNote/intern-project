These first few tests in here test the basic functions of the RPS class. they 
make sure the game plays out as it should for all scenarios. There is also a test 
to see if if an error is raised if an incorrct arguement is passed in. 

The second set of tests tests the tournament function and sees if it provides the 
correct winner given an array of matches. there is also a test to see if the tornament 
function also works for a single match.

my test verifies that the exception works in the tournament function as well by passing 
an invalid argument to a player later in the tournament.
